System levels are as follows:
-----------------------------
-1 = health facility (should not be included in code because HF do not have computers and therefore only generate paper forms)
0  = district
1  = national ref lab
2  = region
3  = MoH
4  = Menafrinet

Data flows:

HF -> District -> (Region and NRL) -> MoH -> Menafrinet

Additionally, some NRL data flows back to region and/or district.
